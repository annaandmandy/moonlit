Motive: Priest Aqi discovered that she was intermarrying with humans in her human form, violating the precepts of Qingqiu. She used illusions to guide Yingzhao to see the \"snake shadow\" and manipulated 狌狌 to spread panic. Her original intention was not to kill but to \"seize his heart to break the seal\", but the ritual backfired. The real \"poisonous gas\" originated from the remaining Xiangliu Nianling beneath the altar.",
